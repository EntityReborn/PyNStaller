Py-N-Staller
============

Python and PyQt4 based post installer, for all supported platforms.
Entries are INI based, and can be anywhere inside the Installers directory
(with the extension .info), and presets can be anywhere inside the Presets 
directory (with the extension .preset).

The core has been written with GUI-portability in mind, and doesn't use GUI
libraries at all.

Please note:
This software is 100% PRE-ALPHA! Bugs are all around, and features aren't fully 
implemented.
